\chapter{About this book}
This book was lovingly typeset using \LaTeX~and
a modified version of the layout found at
\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/366262}.

\smallskip
Several recipes have tags in the page headers.
{\color{frzcolor}FF} stands for freezer-friendly,
meaning the item can be frozen indefinitely 
(as far as we know) and thawed later.
These are often good choices for bulk cooking.
{\color{vegcolor}V} and {\color{vgncolor}V} denote
vegetarian and vegan recipes, respectively.

\smallskip
A quick word on release editions:
if you're holding a book that says
``Edition $x$, Preview $y$'' on the title page,
then I don't know how you got it,
but it probably wasn't one of us.
Preview editions are considered 
interim digital versions only 
and may contain incomplete recipes, misspellings, 
or other such oddities.

\smallskip
With that, enjoy the book, and happy cooking!

\recipe[]{Creamy Pecan Pralines}
\serves{18 pcs.}
\begin{ingreds}
  1 cup granulated sugar
  1 cup (packed) light brown sugar
  2 tablespoons light corn syrup
  2 tablespoons butter
  Pinch of salt
  1/2 cup sweetened condensed milk
  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  1 1/2 cups pecan pieces
\end{ingreds}
\begin{method}
  Combine the sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, salt,
  and condensed milk in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.

  With a wooden spoon, stir until the sugar dissolves.
  Continue to cook, stirring, until smooth and light brown,
  about 8 minutes.

  Add the vanilla and pecans and continue to cook,
  stirring, until the mixture reaches \ftemp{234} to
  \ftemp{240} on a candy thermometer or the soft ball stage,
  that is, when a bit dropped into cold water
  forms a soft ball that flattens.

  Remove from the heat and drop by the spoonful onto wax paper.
  Let cool.

  Remove from the paper with a thin knife.
  Pralines can be stored in an airtight container
  at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.

  If you attempt to roast the pecans yourself,
  be sure to check them frequently!
  They can and \emph{will} catch fire if left unattended
  (we know from experience).
