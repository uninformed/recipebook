# The T&A recipe book
No, it's not what you think.
Those are just our initials.
This is a collection of recipes we've compiled over time,
specifically to aid in our meal prepping.

Whole-number editions correspond to print-ready versions;
editions with both a major and minor
version number are intermediate digital editions.
