# The T&A recipe book
No, it's not what you think.
Those are just our initials.
This is a collection of recipes we've compiled over time,
specifically to aid in our meal prepping.

Versions are tagged with an edition-preview convention:
1-3 means "1st edition, preview 3",
and 2-final means "2nd edition, print-ready".
