\chapter{About this book}
This book was lovingly typeset using \LaTeX~and
a modified version of the layout found at
\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/366262}.

\smallskip
Several recipes have tags in the page headers.
{\color{frzcolor}FF} stands for freezer-friendly,
meaning the item can be frozen indefinitely
(as far as we know) and thawed later.
These are often good choices for bulk cooking.
{\color{vegcolor}V} and {\color{vgncolor}V} denote
vegetarian and vegan recipes, respectively.

\smallskip
A quick word on release editions:
if you're holding a book that says
``Edition $x$, Preview $y$'' on the title page,
then I don't know how you got it,
but it probably wasn't one of us.
Preview editions are considered
interim digital versions only
and may contain incomplete recipes, misspellings,
or other such oddities.

\smallskip
With that, enjoy the book, and happy cooking!
